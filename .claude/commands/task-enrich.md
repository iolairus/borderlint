description: Enrich an existing task — edge cases, scenarios, estimate, DoD
---

Enrich the task `$ARGUMENTS` (a Jira key like `PROJ-123`, or a path) in `backlog/tasks/`.

**Steps**

1. Locate the task file. If the argument is ambiguous or missing, list tasks with `status: draft` and ask.

   All additions are written in **English** (the repo's only content language).

2. Cross-check against `openspec/specs/` and the source discovery doc: does it contradict current behavior? Does it overlap another task?

3. Enrich the task:
   - **Scenarios** — add missing unhappy paths: invalid input, permissions, empty states, concurrency, limits. Every Then must be observable/testable.
   - **Notes & edge cases** — record decisions and discovered constraints.
   - **Estimate** — propose one with a line of justification (points or hours per project convention).
   - **Ambiguities** — if any acceptance criterion is untestable as written, ask the user with **AskUserQuestion** rather than guessing.

4. Update frontmatter: `status: enriched`, `estimate`.

5. Run the `task-reviewer` subagent on the result. If it returns REVISE, fix the findings and re-run once.

6. Suggest next: `/task-jira <id>` to export, or `/opsx-propose` referencing the task to start implementation.
