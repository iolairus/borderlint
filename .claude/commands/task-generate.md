description: Generate work tasks (Jira-mapped) from a discovery doc into backlog/tasks/
---

Generate tasks from the discovery doc `backlog/discovery/$ARGUMENTS.md` using `templates/task.md`.

**Steps**

1. Read the discovery doc. If it doesn't exist, list available ones and ask which to use (or suggest `/req-capture` first).

   **Language gate (mandatory):** ask with **AskUserQuestion** whether the tasks must be written in **castellano** or **English**. Preselect `content.default_language` from `workflow.yaml`, but always ask — these texts end up in front of the client. Record the choice in each task's frontmatter as `language: es|en`.

2. Read `workflow.yaml` (`jira.project_key`, `backlog.tasks_dir`).

3. Slice the functional needs into tasks. Rules:
   - One verifiable outcome per task; split anything you couldn't implement in one OpenSpec change.
   - Each task gets a **Goal** (what & why), **Context**, and at least one Gherkin scenario per acceptance criterion, including one unhappy path. Every Then must be observable/testable.
   - Non-functional needs become acceptance criteria on the tasks they constrain, or their own task if cross-cutting.
   - Do NOT create tasks from **Open questions** — list them at the end as "blocked: needs answer".

4. **Task IDs are Jira keys.** Show the user the proposed task list (title + one-line goal) and ask them to provide the Jira ID for each (e.g. `PROJ-123`). For tasks not yet created in Jira, assign draft IDs `<project_key>-D01`, `-D02`, ... and note they must be renamed when the real key exists.

5. Write each task to `backlog/tasks/<id>-<slug>.md` with frontmatter filled: `id`, `title`, `status: draft`, `discovery`, `priority` (MoSCoW from the discovery's goals), `language`.

6. Suggest `/task-enrich <id>` for the ones to refine, or `/task-jira <id>` to export.
